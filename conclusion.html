Throughout this project, we have used a number of information on skincare products collected from Sephora website to gain insight on the information that influences the number of people recommending a product, or the number of Loves. <a href="study1.html">Case study 1</a> shows that the number of reviews have a positive influence on the number of loves. <a href="study2.html">Case study 2</a> shows that having the Clean at Sephora seal, i.e. not including a number of harmful ingredients in the products as Clean at Sephora requires, increases the number of loves for the product. <a href="study3.html">Case study 3</a> shows that there are statistically differences in the number of loves from different categories of skincare. <a href="study4.html">Case study 4</a> reconfirms all of the results from the previous case studies as the final model include the log number of reviews, Clean at Sephora seal, and skincare categories as significant predictors for the number of loves. In addition, the final model also include price per ounce and the appearance of palm oil as significant predictors, both with negative influence of the number of loves. Interestingly, palm oil is the only harmful ingredient identified in this project that are included in the final model. A reason can be that the Clean at Sephora seal has already accounted for the other ingredients. Further examination could give us more insight on these observations.
