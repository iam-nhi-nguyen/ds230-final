<h2>Case Study 2: Does Clean at Sephora seal makes a difference to means of logLove?</h2>
</header>

<section class="main-section first-section">

<h3>Box Plot</h3>
</header>

<p>
Clean at Sephora seal was introduced in part to encourage customers to
shop clean products. We can perform a two sample t-test on logLove by
whether or not the product has Clean at Sephora seal to see if this seal
makes a statistically significant difference in means of log number of
people recommending a product.
</p>

<p>
First, we want to take a loot at the boxplot of logLove by Clean variable.    
</p>

<p><img src="boxplot.png"></p>

<p>
Visually, in terms of means, medians, quantiles, and range, there are
clear differences for the logLove between products that has Clean at
Sephora seal and those that do not have the seal.
</p>

<h3>T-Test</h3>
</header>

<p>We can use a two sample t-test to check wheather these differences are significant.</p>

<pre class="r"><code>(test1 &lt;- t.test(logLove ~ Clean, conf = 0.99))</code></pre>

<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  logLove by Clean
## t = -5.3968, df = 1487.3, p-value = 7.885e-08
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 99 percent confidence interval:
##  -0.5068589 -0.1790579
## sample estimates:
## mean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE 
##            8.719067            9.062025</code></pre>

<p>
The p-value for the t-test is extremely small, and the 99% confidence
interval (-0.51 -0.18) doesnâ€™t include 0. Thus, we are 99% confidence
that there is a difference between means of logLove with and without
Clean at Sephora seal.
</p>

<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
</header>

<p>
To be even more certain, we will now create a bootstrap interval for
this t-test and compare the result with the theoretical interval.
</p>

<p>
The bootstrap interval is basically the same as the theoretical interval.
</p>

<h3>Permutation Test</h3>
</header>

<p>
We want to see how likely it is that the observed difference is due
to random chance, using permutation test.
</p>

<img src="permutation.png">

<p>
The actual difference in means of logLove is smaller than any of
the difference of logLove generated from a fake sample. This suggests
a 0 p-value, which is an extremely strong evidence that the observed
difference is due to random chance.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</header>

<p>
These results suggest that there is a strong evidence that there is
a difference between the means of log of the number of customers
recommending products (logLove) with and without Clean at Sephora seal.
