                    Sephora is one of the foremost prestige beauty site on the
                    internet, with around 300 brands on the whole website and
                    over 2,700 skincare products alone. Each product's webpage
                    is packed with information about the product, such as name,
                    brand, price, category, and detailed description and list of
                    ingredients. In addition, new customers can gain insight from
                    others' purchases by looking at the number of Reviews (total
                    number of customers who leave a review at the end of the
                    webpage) and the number of Loves (total number of customers
                    who recommended buying the product).

                    In 2018, Sephora lauched the
                    <a href="https://www.sephora.com/beauty/clean-beauty-products">Clean at Sephora seal</a>
                    as a response to an increase number of articles on questionable
                    ingredients found in cosmetics that are either harmful for
                    customers to use on their skin, or their process of
                    harvesting causes environmental issues. Clean at Sephora products
                    are claimed to not include a certain list of harmful ingredients
                    (the full list can be found in the Data section). Clean at Sephoraseal
                    is supposed to force brands to be transparent about their ingredient
                    list and encourage customers to shop clean products.
